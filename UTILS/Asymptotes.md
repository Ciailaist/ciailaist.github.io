= a line that the graph gets infinitely close to, but doesn't cross

**There are three main types:**

| Concept                  | Definition              | How to find                            | Example    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Vertical asymptote**   | Function → ±∞ near x= a | Denominator = 0 and numerator $\neq 0$ | x=0 in 1/x |
| **Horizontal asymptote** | Function → constant     | Limit at infinity                      | y=0 in 1/x |
| **Oblique asymptote**    | Function → slanted line | Polynomial long division               | y = mx + q |
