"ln" is the natural logarithm, which is the logarithm based on euler's number $e$. Basically, $\ln(x)$ answers the question "to which power should I elevate $e$ to obtain $x$?"

+ **Base**: its base is $e$
+ **Inverse of exponential function:** the exponential function and the natural logarithm are inverse function, such that if $y = e^x$, then $x = \ln(y)$ 
+ **Value of x:** in a natural logarithm $x$ should always be $x>0$, since negative values and 0 are undefined and generate an error.
