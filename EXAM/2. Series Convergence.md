Determine whether the following series are divergent or convergent, and explain why. To show your claim you may use any theorem from the lecture.

By simplifying the denominator $(\sqrt{n})^3 = n^{3/2}$ the general term is now:
$$a_n = \frac{2+(-2)^n}{n^{3/2}} = \frac{2}{n^{3/2}} + \frac{(-2)^n}{n^{3/2}}$$

###### Check the denominator
With growing of n, $(\sqrt{n})^3 = n^{3/2}$ also becomes big. If the denominator grows, then the terms get smaller.

###### Check the numerator
$$2+(-2)^n$$
+ if n is even, $(-2)^n$ is positive and grows a lot
+ if n is odd, $(-2)^n$ is negative and grows in absolute value
-> the numerator then oscillates between big positive and big negative numbers.

###### Compare numerator and denominator growth
+ numerator grows like $2^n$ (quick)
+ denominator grows like $n^{1.5}$ (quite slower)

The terms $\frac{(-2)^n}{n^{3/2}}$ become thus bigger, so the sum of the terms cannot approach a fixed number. The series is **divergent**.

By separating the powers
$$\frac{e^{n-2}}{\pi^{n+3}} = \frac{e^{n}}{\pi^{n}} \cdot \frac{e^{-2}}{\pi^{3}}$$
we notice that the second part $\frac{e^{-2}}{\pi^{3}}$ is a fixed number (does not depend on n). The part that changes is $(\frac{n}{\pi})^n$.

###### Geometric sequence
A geometric sequence is always has this form:
$$a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+... = \sum^\infty_{n=0}ar^n$$
Comparing it to our case, it has the same shape, with:
+ $a=\frac{e^{-2}}{\pi^{3}}$ which acts as first "fixed" term
+ $r= \frac{e}{\pi}$ which is the ratio
Thus our series is a geometric sequence.

By geometric sequence, if the ratio is < 1, then the series converges. Otherwise, diverges.
$$r = \frac{e}{\pi} \approx \frac{2.718}{3.141} \approx 0.865 < 1$$
So, the series **converges**.
