##### Find the domain of $f(x)$

Denominator $1-x^2 \neq 0 \implies x \neq \pm 1$
Domain: $(-\infty, -1) \cup (-1, 1) \cup (1, \infty)$

##### Evaluate the first and second derivatives of $f(x)$

Check [[How to derivate]]

$f'(x) = \frac{1+x^2}{(1-x^2)^2}$
$f''(x) = \frac{2x(3+x^2)}{(1-x^2)^3}$

##### Determine the intervals of x where the function f(x) is strictly convex or concave

Check the sign of $f''(x)$. Since $3+x^2>0$, sign of $\frac{x}{(1-x^2)^3}$. That gives:
+ On $(-\infty, -1): f'' > 0$ -> convex
+ On $(-1,0): f'' < 0$ -> concave
+ On $(0, 1): f'' > 0$ -> convex
+ On $(1, \infty): f'' > 0$ -> concave

##### Determine the local (or global) maximum and minimum of the function f(x)

No local or global extrema inside the domain because $f'$ never changes sign (always positive)

##### Find inflection of f(x) if the they exists

Based on $f''$:
+ The numerator $2x(3+x^2)$ can change sign only because of the $x$ (since $3+x^2 > 0$)
+ The denominator $(1-x^2)^3$ can also change sign, but it's undefined at $x=\pm 1$ (because the denominator then = 0, so those aren't actual points on the curve)
Lets' check the signs of $f''$(x):

| Interval   | Denomiantor | Numerator | Sign of $f''(x)$ | Shape   |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| x < -1     | -           | -         | +                | convex  |
| -1 < x < 0 | +           | -         | -                | concave |
| 0 < x < 1  | +           | +         | +                | convex  |
| x > 1      | -           | +         | -                | concave |

The sign changes at -1, 0 and at 1, BUT since -1 and 1 aren't actual points on the graph and thus $f(x)$ does not exist there, the only inflection point is at $x=0$, which is (0,0)


##### Find horizontal, vertical or oblique asymptotes of f if they exist.

-> Check [[Asymptotes]]

Recall the function:
$$f(x) = \frac{x}{1-x^2}$$

###### Vertical asymptotes
Solve $1-x^2=0$, which is $x=\pm 1$. Numerator at those points $\neq 0$, so there are vertical asymptotes at $x=-1$ and $x=1$
###### Horizontal asymptotes
Compute $\lim_{x\to \pm \infty}f(x)$
For large |x|:
+ The numerator behaves like x
+ The denominator behaves like $1-x^2 \approx <x^2$ (since $x^2$ is huge compared to 1)
So $f(x) \approx \frac{x}{-x^2} = - \frac{1}{x}$

+ When $x \to +\infty, -\frac{1}{x} \to 0$
+ When $x \to -\infty, -\frac{1}{x} \to 0$
Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is the line $y = 0$.
###### Oblique asymptotes
Oblique asymptotes occur if the numerator degree is exactly one higher than the denominator degree. Here numerator degree = 1, denominator degree = 2. Denominator degree is larger, so there is <u>no oblique asymptote</u>.
