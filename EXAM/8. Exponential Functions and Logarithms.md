$$\log_a b$$
"At what power should I elevate $a$ to obtain $b$?"

$\log$ is defined only for $b>0$ and for $a >0$ AND $a \neq 1$.

*Find x ∈ R for which it holds...*

###### Step 1: check where is defined
We know for which values a logarithm is defined, so e.g. $\ln(2x)$ needs $2x > 0$, so $x > 0$.
