###### Sketch the plot of f(x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2.

Do it for x = 0, x= 1 and x =2.

###### Argue if f is differentiable on R, and if not at which points and why.

A function $f(x)$ is differentiable at a point $x_0​$ if his derivative exists at that point.  
Furthermore, if exists a limit such that:
$$f'(x_0) = \lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0}$$

For our function, we know that:

$-|x-1|+1 = \begin{cases}1-x &\text{if } x < 1 \\ x-1 &\text{if } x > 1\end{cases}$

 
If a function is a straight line $y= ax + b$, its derivative is $a$ (the slope). So:
+ For the line $y=x$ the slope is 1, so the derivative is 1.
+ For the line $y=-x+2$ it's -1.
This makes the derivative:
$f'(x) = \begin{cases}1 &\text{if } x < 1 \\ -1 &\text{if } x > 1\end{cases}$

What happens then when $x=1$?
To check if the derivative exists at 1, we need to check the limits of the incremental ratio $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ coming from the left and from the right.

What the incremental ratio is:
