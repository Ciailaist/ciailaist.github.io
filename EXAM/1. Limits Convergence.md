Determine whether the following limits are divergent or convergent, and explain why. Also, in case they converge show the number to which they converge, or if they diverge show if they diverge to some ±∞ or not. To show your claim may use any theorem from the lecture.

###### Use the absolute value
+ $(-1)^n$ has value $\pm 1$
+ $\cos(n^2+1)$ is between -1 and 1
+ so $(-1)^n \cos(n^2 +1)$ is also between -1 and 1

$|(-1)^n \cos(n^2 +1)(n^2+2n)|\leq n^2+2n$

so we know that:
$$\bigg |\frac{(-1)^n \cos(n^2 +1)(n^2+2n)}{4^n+5n+2}\bigg |\leq \frac{n^2+2n}{4^n+5n+2}$$

###### Find an "upper limit"
Since $4^n+5n+2 > 4^n$ (for every n big enough), then:
$$\frac{n^2+2n}{4^n+5n+2} < \frac{n^2+2n}{4^n}$$
+ the numerator grows like a polynomial
+ the denominator grows like an exponential, which is faster
*So, intuitively, the fraction should near 0. But we need to prove it yet-*

This is the setup for the squeeze/sandwich theorem:
$$0 \leq \bigg |\frac{(-1)^n \cos(n^2 +1)(n^2+2n)}{4^n+5n+2}\bigg | \leq \frac{n^2+2n}{4n}$$

###### Right side limit

###### Squeeze theorem
By squeeze theorem, since both extremes approach 0, also the one in the middle approaches 0.

Let $M = \max\{a_1, a_2, a_3\}$. Since M is the max:
$$M^n \leq a_1^n + a_2^n + a_3^n \leq M^n + M^n + M^n = 3M^n$$
Now, with the square root:
$$M \leq \sqrt[n]{a_1^n + a_2^n + a_3^n} \leq \sqrt[n]{3M^n} = M \cdot 3^{1/n}$$
###### Limit of $3^{1/n}$
It is known that when $3^{1/n} \to 1$ when $n \to \infty$ (since $1/n$ approaches 0).

So, by squeeze theorem:
